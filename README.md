## Prblem Statement:
### US visa approval status

Given certain set of features such as (continent, education, job_experience, employment, current age ect)

We have to predict whether the appication for the visa will be aproved or not.

## Solution Scope:
This can be used on real life by US visa applicants so that they can improve their Resume and criteria for the approval process.

### Solution Approach:
* Machine Learning: ML Classification Algorithms

### Solution Proposed:
I will be using ML
1. Load the data from Database
2. Perform EDA and feature engineering to select the desirable features.
3. Fit the Ml classification Algorithm and find out which one perform better.
4. Select top few and tune hyperparameters.
5. Select the best model based on desired metrics.
